    "# Dynamic instrument cuts with MCPL bridges\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some instances where it is beneficial to write to McStas instruments to simulate something by transfering the beam from one to the other through an MCPL file. This is most commonly done to save on computational time, imagine for example an instrument with a long complicated guide with high resolution choppers, only allowing few neutrons through. If one wants to simulate a number of different samples on such an instrument, it would be nice to run the simulation up until the end of the guide once, and then once for each sample starting after the guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "That can be done in McStas using the MCPL output and MCPL_input component, which saves and loads the beam to a file respectively. Then one would have two instrument files, the first ending with an MCPL_output, and the next starting with an MCPL_input. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In McStasScript it is possible to do the same thing dynamically through the instrument object. The instrument can be executed in segments, and the MCPL_output / MCPL_input components are added automatically. The instrument object will also keep track of the generated MCPL files. This tutorial will show an example of how this can be done, and importantly show that there are some limitations on how the instrument is written to allow for this."
