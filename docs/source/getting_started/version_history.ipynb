    "## 0.0.58 - 25th of April 2023\n",
    "- Support for new McStas features\n",
    "    - DEPENDENCY: instrument.set_dependency [info here](../user_guide/instrument_object.ipynb)\n",

    "- Infers parameter, variable and component names\n",
    "    - Each time anything is added to an instrument, one gives it a name and python variable name, now the McStas name can be inferred from the python name so the following statements are equivalent:\n",
    "        - wavelength = instrument.add_parameter(\"wavelength\", value=5.0)\n",
    "        - wavelength = instrument.add_parameter(value=5.0)\n",
    "    - And likewise\n",
    "        - my_arm = instrument.add_component(\"my_arm\", \"Arm\")\n",
    "        - my_arm = instrument.add_component(\"Arm)\n",
    "- Examples are being updated to run McStas 3.X, not all documentation updated yet\n",

    "\n",
    "## 0.0.51 - 17th of October 2022\n",

    "    - instrument_reader can read McStas 3.X files with simple USERVARS\n",
    "- Improvements to instrument diagrams\n",
    "- Introduced checks for using same name for parameters, declare variables and user variables\n",

    "    - Colors component depending on category\n",
    "    - EXTEND and WHEN shown with decorating component box\n",
    "    - Hovering mouse over left side of box shows component info\n",
    "    - All Union connections included\n",
    "    - Improved line arrows to turn in a few segments, greatly clarifying reading busy diagrams\n",
    "    - Included in all documentation\n",
    "- Bug fix in simulator widget that avoids a crash when value in text field could not be converted to float\n",
    "- Included documentation on widgets in [widget_user_guide](../user_guide/widgets.ipynb)\n",
    "- Now allows for spaces in McStas path, working on how this could work for data path\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.0.47 - 31th of May 2022\n",
    "Introducing instrument diagrams, they are really useful for getting a quick overview of an instrument\n",
    "- Instrument diagrams now available, use the instrument method *show_diagram*\n",
    "- Instrument output_path now reports to libpyvinyl calculator path system (Thanks Shervin)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.0.44 - 16th of May 2022\n",
    "This version is a cleanup of the syntax and streamlining of the package. It improves the consistency of the language use, removes unused methods and is better at recognizing when wrong input is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Renaming of methods to make the \"show\" verb in method names more consistent.\n",
    "    - show_components did show all available McStas components, now shows components in current instrument\n",
    "    - print_components still shows all components in current instrument, but also a warning pointing to show_instrument as best practice\n",
    "    - available_components now shows all available McStas components for help purposes\n",
    "- Moved away from allowing arbitrary keyword arguments in some places, so it is now an error to misspell keyword arguments.\n",
    "    - Instrument initialization\n",
    "    - Instrument.settings method\n",
    "    - Instrument.show_components (and print_components) methods\n",
    "    - Component initialization\n",
    "- Removed instrument methods for manipulating components like set_component_AT() as they provided an additional way of doing the same thing, but more error prone than working with the component objects directly.\n",
    "- Moved widgets out of base import of package to speed up import\n",
    "- Widgets for Jupyter notebooks now loaded with: \n",
    "    - *import mcstasscript.jb_interface as ms_widget*\n",
    "    - ms_widget.show(instrument) / ms_widget.show(data) shows widget interface for instrument / data\n",

    "    - Checks that variables used as component parameters have been declared\n",
    "- When using show_instrument in a notebook, a new tab was opened and it was shown in the notebook, changed it so no new tab is made when running in a notebook. If a new tab is desired use the keyword argument *new_tab* and set it to True."
